# PEM-SMC-AFP Algorithm – MATLAB Code

This repository bundles the MATLAB code used in the PEM-SMC-AFP study:

- **PEM-SMC-AFP/** – tempered Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm with adaptive tempering,
  flexible move scheduling, and parallelism.  
  Detailed installation and usage instructions are given in `PEM-SMC-AFP/README.md`.

- **MT_DREAM(ZS)/** – MT-DREAM(ZS) sampler used as a baseline in the CoLM case studies.  
  See `MT_DREAM(ZS)/README.md` for details.
